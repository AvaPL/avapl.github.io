# Hi!

<p style="text-align: justify">
My name is <b>Pawe≈Ç</b> and I'm a backend developer. I find writing about myself quite hard, but I've picked a theme
that already has this subpage, so I'll try to do my best.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I'm interested in a wide spectrum of concepts related to backend development, including JVM languages, object-oriented
and functional paradigms, reactive systems, and all that buzzwords like microservices or event sourcing. I'm also not
scared of cloud or CI/CD topics. What I'm scared of is the frontend. Whenever I touch anything related to it, it ends
with a disaster. For me, an API is the most beautiful user interface, so you won't find any frontend mentions here,
maybe except some grumbling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I've created this website to share my experience and create some kind of persistence for my knowledge so that I can
return to it later. I hope that somebody will also find it useful.
</p>
