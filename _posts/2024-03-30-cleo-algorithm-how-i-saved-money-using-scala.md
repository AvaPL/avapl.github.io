We often perceive programming as ~~a way to earn money~~ a hobby, yet seldom consider its potential for saving money. In
this post, I share a story of how I reduced some expenses through the implementation of a simple algorithm in Scala.

## Background

In Poland, there is a store specializing in home appliances with a rather unconventional discount program. At first
glance, the program appears straightforward: the more products you purchase, the greater the discount you receive. For
the sake of this discussion, let's abstract from the Polish currency and
utilize [Simoleons](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Simoleon).

Here's how the discount program works:

| Products in the cart | Discount                      |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------|
| 1                    | None                          |
| 2                    | -30% off the cheapest product |
| 3                    | -55% off the cheapest product |
| 4                    | -80% off the cheapest product |
| 5 or more            | The cheapest product for ยง1   |

You might already see an opportunity for cost optimization here. Consider this scenario: you wish to purchase three
products priced at **ยง100**, **ยง100**, and **ยง1**. If bought together, the total cost is **ยง200.45**. However, by
splitting the purchase into two orders - **(ยง100, ยง100)** and **(ยง1)** - you'd only pay **ยง171**! This strategy seems
like a reasonable way to save some money, doesn't it?

This observation inspired me to devise a dedicated algorithm to tackle this problem: **the Cleo algorithm**.

## The algorithm

I have to be honest - I didn't delve into any purely mathematical methods to solve the problem. Instead, I opted to
brute force the optimal split. Along the way, I'll explain a few simplifications I made. While there's certainly room
for improvement, I rarely find myself purchasing such a large number of products that would necessitate further
optimization. Let's walk through the steps.

### Types

First, let's define some types to aid our reasoning about the entities we'll manipulate.

[//]: # (@formatter:off)

```scala
type Price = Double
case class Product(name: String, price: Price)
type ProductGroup = Set[Product]
type ProductGroupCombination = Set[ProductGroup]
```

[//]: # (@formatter:on)

Here, `ProductGroup` represents a subset of items you wish to order, and `ProductGroupCombination` is a collection
of product groups that collectively contain all the items you want to order. The meanings of `Price` and `Product` are
self-explanatory.

> Here, you'll notice the first simplification: you cannot have two products with the same name and price. There are

> field to `Product`, like `seqNo: Int = 0`, to distinguish between each occurrence.

### Finding the cheapest combination

Let's begin by defining our desired outcome and then delve into the details. Our primary objective is to identify a
`ProductGroupCombination` with the smallest total price.

The process unfolds as follows:

1. Determine all possible `ProductGroupCombinations` for the given `ProductGroup`.
2. Calculate the price for each combination, factoring in the discount.
3. Identify the combination with the lowest total price.

This process can be easily translated into Scala code:

```scala
def findCheapestCombination(products: ProductGroup): (ProductGroupCombination, Price) =
  getProductGroupCombinations(products) // 1
    .map { combination => // 2
      val totalPrice = combination.map(calculatePriceWithDiscount).sum
      combination -> totalPrice
    }
    .minBy { case (_, totalPrice) => totalPrice } // 3
```

### Calculating the price with discount

Determining the price of a `ProductGroup` with discounts is a straightforward process. Here's what we need to do:

1. Sort the products by price in ascending order.
2. Apply the discount to the cheapest product based on the discount table outlined in the [Background](#background)
   section.
3. Sum the price of the cheapest product with the prices of all other products.

Let's see how this translates into Scala code:

```scala
def calculatePriceWithDiscount(products: ProductGroup): Price = {
  def calculateDiscountPrice(cheapestPrice: Price) = // 2
    products.size match {
      case 0 | 1 => cheapestPrice
      case 2 => cheapestPrice * (1 - 0.3)
      case 3 => cheapestPrice * (1 - 0.55)
      case 4 => cheapestPrice * (1 - 0.8)
      case _ => 1
    }

  products.toList.sortBy(_.price) match { // 1
    case cheapest :: rest =>
      calculateDiscountPrice(cheapest.price) + rest.map(_.price).sum // 3
    case Nil => 0
  }
}
```

Note the simplicity of the code, facilitated by Scala's built-in pattern matching, `sortBy`, and `sum` functions!

### Finding all product group combinations

This is the most intricate aspect of the problem, yet it's surprisingly straightforward, thanks to the methods available
on a `Set`. While there are likely multiple approaches to achieving this, here's the method I've devised:

1. If the `ProductGroup` is empty, return a `Set` with a single, empty `ProductGroupCombination`.
2. Otherwise, identify all non-empty subsets of the input product group. For instance, if the input
   is `{plushie, snack, crayon}`, the subsets would include `{plushie, snack, crayon}` (yes, the same as the
   input), `{plushie, snack}`, `{snack, crayon}`, `{plushie, crayon}`, `{plushie}`, `{snack}`, and `{crayon}`. Here,
   Scala's `subsets` method is particularly helpful.
3. For each subset, determine all combinations of the remaining products. For example, if the subset is `{plushie}`, the
   remaining product combinations would be `[{snack, crayon}]` and `[{snack}, {crayon}]`.
4. Merge each combination with the corresponding subset, generating a `ProductGroupCombination`. The final result is
   a `Set[ProductGroupCombination]`.

_Example subsets and product group combinations_

Here's the corresponding Scala code:

```scala
def getProductGroupCombinations(products: ProductGroup): Set[ProductGroupCombination] =
  if (products.isEmpty) // 1
    Set(Set.empty)
  else {
    for {
      subset <- products.subsets.filter(_.nonEmpty) // 2
      otherSubsets <- getProductGroupCombinations(products.diff(subset)) // 3
    } yield otherSubsets + subset // 4
  }.toSet
```

> The use of `toSet` at the end deduplicates a potentially lengthy list of found combinations. Additionally, it's worth
> noting that the recursive call to `getProductGroupCombinations` is **NOT** tail-recursive, which may result in a stack
> overflow for larger inputs. It's worth considering optimization in this area if necessary.

### Putting it all together

With all the utilities outlined above, we can now optimize our order effortlessly. Calculating the cheapest combination
is now as simple as making a function call:

```scala
val products = Set(
  Product("plushie", 2699),
  Product("glowstick", 1599),
  Product("crayon", 1699),
  Product("bubblewrap", 1299),
  Product("snack", 2599)
)
val (cheapestCombination, lowestPrice) = findCheapestCombination(products)

// Single order price is 8597.0
// The cheapest order combination is [{bubblewrap, crayon, glowstick}, {plushie, snack}] with price 8400.85
```

In the above scenario, we saved almost **ยง200**! It was certainly worth the effort.

## Summary

In this post, we went through a real-life use case of ~~messing around with a store discount program for our own
benefit~~ cost optimization using Scala. Of course, the algorithm could be written in any language but thanks to many
Scala features, it is concise and simple. I hope you're now inspired to look for minor things around you that can be
automated and optimized via a few lines of code.
