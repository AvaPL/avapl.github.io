This year, the post is only a little over a week overdue (last year, it was over a month!). I'm happy to share my
solutions for Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ‰ It's again the latest Scala version (well, almost, as the newer
3.6 [was a mishap](https://www.scala-lang.org/news/post-mortem-3.6.0.html)).

I again had the pleasure of contributing another article to
the [Scala Center Advent of Code page](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/). This time, I shared
my solution for day 19, which involved arranging colorful towels. You can read my
article [here](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2024/puzzles/day19).

In my opinion, this year was a bit easier than the previous one, but much more creative. My favorite puzzles were:

- [Day 14 part 2](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2024/blob/main/src/main/scala/day14/Puzzle2.scala) in which I
  wrote an interactive CLI application using [jline](https://github.com/jline/jline3) to find an image of a Christmas
  tree ðŸŽ„
- [Day 24 part 2](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2024/blob/main/src/main/scala/day24/Puzzle2.scala), which I
  decided to solve by visualizing the input as a Mermaid chart ðŸ“ˆ It also reminded me a few things about logic gates.
- [Day 21](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2024/tree/main/src/main/scala/day21) because the problem was really
  unusual and genuinely made me laugh ðŸ˜„

All my solutions are available [here](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2024). I hope you enjoyed this year's
Advent of Code as much as I did. I'm looking forward to the next one!
