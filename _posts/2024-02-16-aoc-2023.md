I must admit that this blog post is a bit overdue, considering we're already well into the new year, with February 16th
marking its publication. However, as they say, better late than never!

2023 is another year in which I completed Advent of Code in Scala. This was also my first year written fully in Scala 3.
My solutions are available [here](https://github.com/AvaPL/Advent-of-Code-2023).

I also had an opportunity to contribute an article to
the [Scala Center Advent of Code page](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/) for day 22, where I shared
insights into my approach and solution for that specific challenge. If you're interested in diving deeper into the
intricacies of that problem, you can check out my
article [here](https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-advent-of-code/2023/puzzles/day22).

I eagerly look forward to Advent of Code 2024, and I'm hopeful for an opportunity to write another article ðŸ˜„
